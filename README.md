This is a simple Java program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle based on user input. The user is prompted to enter the length and breadth of the rectangle, and the program computes the results using basic mathematical formulas:

Area = length × breadth

Perimeter = 2 × (length + breadth)

This program is ideal for beginners learning Java input/output, variable handling, and basic arithmetic operations.
